## Intro [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onILjIlPCRA&t=0s)
- Hyperbaric oxygen therapy ([HBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine)) involves increased atmospheric pressure and increased inspired oxygen.
- Oxygen is essential for energy production and is carried by red blood cells.
- Oxygen-carrying capacity is limited by the number of red blood cells and the amount of oxygen they can carry.
- HBOT can increase oxygen in circulation by driving more oxygen into the plasma or liquid of the bloodstream.
- This can result in up to 1,200% more oxygen in circulation.
## Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) for Improved Performance [(00:04:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onILjIlPCRA&t=247s)
- After exiting a hyperbaric chamber, there's a 30-minute window where the body has 1200% more oxygen in circulation.
- Athletes can use this increased oxygen capacity to train harder and longer, delaying the onset of lactic acidosis.
- Some athletes, including tennis players, use hyperbaric chambers before competitions to enhance their performance.
- HBOT can also aid in recovery after exercise by facilitating the body's natural recovery processes.
## 5 Benefits of HBOT [(00:05:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onILjIlPCRA&t=350s)
- Reverses low oxygen states, saving tissue in cases of acute trauma, such as traumatic brain injury, stroke, heart attack, or spinal cord injury.
- Decreases inflammation and swelling, aiding in the healing process.
- Improves immune system function, accelerating healing by 30-70% compared to regular healing.
- Stimulates stem cell release, promoting the creation of new tissue, including brain, heart, and muscle tissue.
- Helps with infections that do not thrive in high oxygen environments.
## Does HBOT Blunt the Benefits of Exercise? [(00:08:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onILjIlPCRA&t=482s)
- Hyperbaric therapy ([HBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine)) is a hormetic stress that creates oxidative stress and shifts epigenetics.
- Using HBOT immediately after exercise may blunt the body's natural adaptation to exercise.
- HBOT can be used 3-4 hours after exercise to aid in recovery.
- [HBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine) improves blood flow and lymphatic flow, aiding in detoxification.
- HBOT can be used before exercise to increase oxygen-carrying capacity.
- HBOT may delay the lactate threshold, allowing for more work and greater adaptation.
- These benefits have been observed in athletes but lack extensive scientific studies.
## Improvement in Vo2max [(00:11:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onILjIlPCRA&t=680s)
- Hyperbaric therapy increases V2 Max, which is a longevity marker.
- Hyperbaric therapy reverses low oxygen states by shifting expression of genes responsible for increasing blood vascular growth.
- Hyperbaric therapy creates new blood vessels in the brain, heart, genital region, and other parts of the body.
- Increased blood vascular density in the heart allows for sustained tissue and increased capacity to maintain blood flow, preventing lactic acidosis and allowing for improved performance.
## More Blood Flow & Collagen Production (skin health) [(00:13:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onILjIlPCRA&t=791s)
- Hyperbaric therapy can increase collagen production.
- Hyperbaric therapy increases the cells that help build up bone.
- Hyperbaric therapy improves vascularization in tough-to-reach tissues like cartilage.
- Hyperbaric therapy is most effective when combined with other interventions for cartilage production, such as peptides, [PRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet-rich_plasma), or stem cell injections.
- Hyperbaric therapy can improve skin hydration and appearance, giving it a more youthful look.
- Hyperbaric therapy has the potential to increase longevity and healthspan.
## Effect of HBOT on Healthspan & Mitochondria [(00:15:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onILjIlPCRA&t=945s)
- Hyperbaric oxygen therapy ([HBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine)) improves mitochondrial health, promoting longevity and recovery.
- HBOT stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis, rebuilding new mitochondria and reducing senescent cells associated with degeneration and cancer.
- HBOT regenerates mitochondrial function, promoting cellular renewal and allowing cells to sense when they need to die and be replaced.
- [HBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine) works through epigenetic mechanisms to influence gene expression, promoting growth, reducing apoptosis, stimulating new blood vessel formation, and decreasing inflammation.
- Longer HBOT protocols (e.g., 5 days a week for several weeks) provide both immediate benefits during therapy (e.g., reduced inflammation, stem cell activation) and long-term benefits (e.g., epigenetic shifts, sustained reduction in inflammatory markers, improved wound healing).
## Effect on Sleep & the Glymphatic System [(00:22:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onILjIlPCRA&t=1338s)
- Hyperbaric therapy infuses oxygen into all fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid, increasing oxygen delivery to brain cells.
- Increased energy production in brain cells leads to the need for waste removal.
- Hyperbaric therapy creates a micro-massage effect on blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and glymphatic vessels, enhancing the movement of waste products out of cells and into the lymphatic system for detoxification.
- Pressure, a crucial aspect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, improves lymphatic flow and energy production in mitochondria, even without additional oxygen.
- Clinical experience suggests that hyperbaric therapy a few hours before bedtime improves sleep scores, recovery scores, HRV, and deep sleep, allowing athletes to achieve the same level of recovery with less sleep.
## HBOT & Keto [(00:25:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onILjIlPCRA&t=1524s)
- Hyperbaric therapy (HBOT) can be combined with a ketogenic diet for various benefits.
- As we age, our brains become less efficient at using glucose for energy, but our ability to use ketones remains the same.
- [HBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine) combined with a low-carb or keto diet can significantly improve energy production in individuals with brain injuries, Alzheimer's disease, or cognitive impairment.
- Ketones protect the brain from oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species, reducing the risk of seizures during HBOT.
- For individuals with brain-related issues, a ketogenic diet or modified Atkins diet combined with exogenous ketones is recommended during HBOT.
## When to Use (and not use) HBOT [(00:27:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onILjIlPCRA&t=1627s)
- Hyperbaric oxygen therapy ([HBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine)) can reduce inflammation, promote stem cell production, stimulate new blood vessel growth, and enhance lymphatic flow, making it beneficial for longevity and optimal health.
- Individuals under significant stress, overtraining, or with chronic infections or autoimmunity should consult a professional before undergoing HBOT due to potential negative effects.
- Pregnant women, individuals with a fever, lung disease, empyema, or those requiring oxygen should avoid HBOT due to potential risks.
- Consulting with a knowledgeable professional before undergoing [HBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine) is recommended to ensure safety and determine appropriate protocols.
- HBOT can cause ear pressure changes similar to those experienced during air travel, and nasal congestion can make it harder to clear pressure in the chamber, so it's best to avoid HBOT if congested.
- For athletes, using [HBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine) during de-loading weeks with milder pressures (1.3 atmospheres) can aid in recovery, while deeper pressures (above 1.7 atmospheres) should be used cautiously during heavy training weeks to avoid excessive oxidative stress.
- HBOT is generally more beneficial for recovery rather than immediately before intense workouts, but one-off HBOT sessions can be helpful before short, intense workouts or maximal lifts.
